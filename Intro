How Ansible connects to node?

Ansible uses SSH
Ansible needs inventory

After logging into the ec2 instance, you need to install the ansible with latest version and use the below commands to SSH the other instances.

CMD - ansible -i instance1 IP, instance2 IP -m ping (ansible.builtin.ping) -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps

Ex:  ansible -i 172.31.81.142,172.31.82.209 -m ping -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps or

You can use the inventory file (save the above instance IP's in one file and use in the command execution)

Ex:  vi inv

     [web]
     172.31.81.142 

     [App]
     172.31.82.209

CMD - ansible -i inv web App -m ping -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps 

If you want SSH only one instance use the below command.

CMD - ansible -i inv web -m ping -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps
